## Additional Terms for Color Psychology Research

The color psychology themes and research citations included in this software are 
based on peer-reviewed scientific studies. While we strive for accuracy in 
representing this research, users should:

1. Understand that individual responses to color may vary
2. Consult original research papers for complete scientific context
3. Use the color psychology features as creative aids, not medical interventions
4. Recognize that writing productivity depends on many factors beyond color
